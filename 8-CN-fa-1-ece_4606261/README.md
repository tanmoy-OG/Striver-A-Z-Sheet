# Problem Statement

Define two functions:

1. Maximum: accepts two integers (pass by value) and returns the maximum among the two.
2. Swap: accepts two integers (pass by reference) and swaps the values of the integer variables.

Take an input in main() and use switch-case to determine the function to run and print the desired outputs.

# Example 1:

Input: 'test'=1, 'a'=2 and 'b'=3
Output: 3

# Ecample 2:

Input: 'test'=2, 'a'=4 and 'b'=5
Output: 5 4
