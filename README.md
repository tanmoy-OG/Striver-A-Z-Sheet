# Striver-A-Z-Sheet
Throughout the course, Striver has a total of 455 Lectures, almost all provided with 1-3 practice Problem Statements from Coding Ninjas(CN), LeetCode(LC) and Geeks4Geeks(GFG).

This is a repository where I upload my progress with Striver's A-Z DSA Course, starting from the very basic input output operations to the advanced algorithms.

P.S. I have stopped manually naming files and folders according to topic numbers since it was consuming too much extra time and attention. Simply put, it proved counterproductive.
